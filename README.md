# Project-1-
I will be working with Oregon state data for my project. 

I collected the following data sets:
    1. SARS Covid-19 cases (2020 year)
    2. Number of births in each county (2020 year)
    3. Annual per capita income (2020 year)

Using the collected data, the following questions can be framed:
    1. How did the covid 19 pandemic effect the annual income in each county?
    2. How did the covid 19 pandemic effect the number of births in each county?
    3. Were there less number of births in counties where there was less annual income, during the pandemic?
